# Use Docker to run C++

### Getting started

-  Build the Docker image using the `bash build` command
- Compile C++ source code using the `bash run g++ <file-name>` command (replace `<file-name>` with your C++ program saved in the current directory).
- Run the program `bash run ./a.out`

Basically, the `bash run` command allows you to run a command inside the Ubuntu container with g++ installed.
